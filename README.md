# docker-emberjs
This is a `ember.js` `development` environment, not for `production` (it will be implemented later).

## How to use
1. `git clone` (No more to explain)
2. make sure you have downloaded `docker-compose`, and put it in the right place, for example `/usr/local/bin`
3. `cd` to the dir
4. `docker-compose build`
5. `docker-compose run --rm ember`
6. run `ember new ...`, then `cd` to it and `ember s`
7. enjoy the image :-)
